      <li>Peeing and Pooping <i>(in the backyard mostly. And sometimes inside
          the house - my servants (owners) love it when I do that, they would
          talk a lot when it happens. Humans love to talk.)</i></li>
      <li>Coughing and Puking <i>(I have a medical condition already that makes
          me cough so I puke when I cough. My servants feel so bad about it that
          they let me puke everywhere. They love cleaning after me. I am lucky,
          I get it.)</i></li>
